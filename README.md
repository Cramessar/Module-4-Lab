# Module 4 HTML Assignment

This project is a demonstration of fundamental HTML skills, as outlined in Module 4. Unfortunately I did the Module assignment before this lab so I hope you don't judge me too harshly.

## Project Features

A simple, responsive navigation bar using an unordered list (<ul>).

Includes links to:
Home
About
Contact

None of these work for this lab but see the other assignment for a site with a working nav bar

## Contact Form

Name
Email
Message
Includes a radio button group asking, "How did you find us?" with options for Google, Social Media, and Other.
Submit button included with form validation.

## Product Table

A table with product data
Columns: Product Name, Price, and Quantity.
At least three rows of sample data.
Header row included for column labels.

## Images

Two placeholder images:
The first is a standard image.
The second has rounded corners, styled using CSS.

Not sure if it mattered but I thought it was a nice change from the normal copy paste styling.

## File Structure
index.html: The main HTML file containing all the features.
Styling: The page uses inline CSS for simplicity. I could have made a styles.css but it felt like overkill for a lab

Features include:
Hover effects on navigation links with color change that I like personally. 
Rounded borders for form fields and images.
Responsive table layout.

## Requirements Met
Use of semantic elements (<nav>, <form>, <table>).
Responsive design with the viewport meta tag.
Proper code indentation and comments for clarity.

## Browser Compatibility
I tested and works seamlessly in the main browsers, cant comment on safari because I know how to use a computer, ifkyk.
Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox
Microsoft Edge
